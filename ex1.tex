a) Let $G=(V,E),w$ be our graph and the weight function on the edges accordingly. We will create bipartite graph $G'=(V\times \{0\},V\times \{1\},E')$ where,
$$E' = \{((u,0),(v,1)): (u,v)\in E \}$$
With weight function $w':E'\rightarrow R$, s.t. $w'(((u,0),(v,1))) = w((u,v))$. We will run weighted prefect matching and receive $M$. We will build the cycle cover accordingly to $M$, cycle by cycle. $c_0$ will be constructed by taking and delete an edge $((u,0),(v,1))$ in $M$ and add $(u,v)$ to $c_0$, go on by take $((v,0),(w,1))$ in $M$, remove it from $M$ and add $(v,w)$ to the cycle until we will reach a node which is matched to $(u,1)$. By then we will finish one cycle and if there are more edges in $M$ we will construct a new cycle $c_1$ and so on until there are no more edges to delete in $M$.
\\ 
b) The algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Find min cost cycle cover - denoted by $C = (c_1,\ldots,c_k)$. For every $i \in [k]$, define $e_i = (u_i,v_i)$ as an edge in $c_i$.
	\item $G\leftarrow \{(u_k,v_1)\}$
	\item for $i=1$ to $k-1$ do:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $G \leftarrow G \cup (c_i \setminus \{e_i\} \cup \{u_i,v_{i+1}\})$
	\end{itemize}
	\item $G \leftarrow G \cup (c_i \setminus \{e_i\} \cup \{u_i,v_{i+1}\})$
\end{itemize}
\begin{proof}
We will show :
\begin{enumerate}[I]
	\item $G$ is Hamiltonian cycle. 
	\item cost $G$ is at most $\frac{4}{3}OPT$. 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[I]
	\item We will show the edges in $G$ admit Hamiltonian cycle. We start by $v_1$ and go throug edges of cycle $c_1$ until the node $u_1$ than take the edge $u_1,v_2$ and continue in this fashion until reaching node $u_k$, then taking the edge $\{(u_k,v_1)\}$ and we done,
	\item $cost(C) \le OPT$ because the optimal solution is feasible solution for the cycle cover problem. 
	As each cycle is at least of size of 3 we have that $k\le \frac{|V|}{3}$. $G$ replace $k$ edges of size at least 1 with $k$ edges of size at most $2$, then:
	\begin{align*}
	G \le cost(C) + k \le cost(C) + \frac{|V|}{3} \le OPT +\frac{|V|}{3} \le \frac{4}{3}OPT
	\end{align*}
	And the last inequality is due to the fact that the optimal solution visits $|V|$ edges of weight one at least. 
	
\end{enumerate}	
\end{proof}

\item \begin{enumerate}
	\item We build MST $T = (R,E')$ on the sub graph which includes only nodes in $R$. Our algorithm will return $T$ which is also a feasible solution. We will show $c(T)$ is at most $2OPT$. Let $\tilde T=(\tilde V,\tilde E)$ be the steiner tree which has $c(\tilde T)=OPT$. $c(\tilde T) = \sum_{v\in \tilde V} c(v) + \sum_{e\in \tilde E} c(e)$. In the same way as we showed in class we can have that:
	\begin{align*}
		2 \cdot \sum_{e\in \tilde E} c(e) \ge \sum_{e\in E'} c(e)
	\end{align*}
	 and since $\sum_{v\in R} = 0$ we conclude:
	 $$c(T) = \sum_{v\in R} c(v) + \sum_{e\in E'} c(e) = \sum_{e\in \tilde E} c(e) \le 2OPT$$
